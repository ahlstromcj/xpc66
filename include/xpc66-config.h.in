 *
 *    This header file provide "HAVE" definitions based on detected C/C++
 *    system header files.
 *
 * \library       xpc66
 * \author        Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2022-07-03

 * \license       GNU GPL v2 or above
 *
 *  This file is used mainly for system files and specific build options.  The
 *  main build options are detected at build time via the platform_macros.h
 *  module.
 *
 *  For information on this file, see
 *
 *      https://mesonbuild.com/Configuration.html
 *
 *  These #defines will define the macro value as True or False.
 *  The proper way to test the macro is:
 *
 *      #if RTL66_HAVE_SEMAPHORE_H
 *
 *  We had an error on Arch Linux with "True" apparently not being detected as
 *  a boolean, so we add setting up True/False below. We should perhaps
 *  update this file to better match the descriptions at the URL above.
