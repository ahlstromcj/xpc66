INSTALL for Cfg66 v. 0.1.0 and above

Meson is the build system for the Cfg66 library. Meson 1.1 and above is
required. The 'meson.options' file replaces 'meson_options.txt'.

In order to simplify life, a POSIX shell script, 'work.sh', is provided.
The most important options are:

    -   --clean. Removes all build products from the build directory.
    -   --make or no option. Build the library and test code in DEBUG mode.
    -   --clang. Build the code using the Clang compiler.
    -   --help. Show all available options; there a more than just these.

Build:

    $ ./work.sh --clean (when Meson build/options files change)
    $ ./work.sh --clang (if desired, to use Clang)
    $ ./work.sh         (use default compiler)

Tests:

    TO DO

    $ ./library/tests/tests.sh

    This script runs all of the tests listed in the file
    './library/tests/testlines.list', plus a couple more.

Install:

    The easiest way to install is to use the 'work.sh' script after rebuilding
    for release (i.e. no debug code):

    $ ./work.sh --clean
    $ ./work.sh --release
    $ ./work.sh --install

    Of course, one can use Meson without this script if desired. Study the
    script for details.

Subproject:

    If one does not want to install Cfg66, Meson '*.wrap' files are
    provided to use Cfg66 as a Meson subproject.

    See extras/wraps/potext-git.wrap in particular.

    -   Make sure the using project is built using Meson.
    -   Create a 'subprojects' directory in the using project.
    -   Copy the desired '.wrap' file from the 'extras/wraps' directory
        into 'subprojects'.
    -   Build!

    An example is included: copy the file extras/code/mini-potext-test.tar.xz
    to a safe place (such as a temp directory). In that directory, do:

        $ tar xf mini-potext-test.tar.xz
        $ cd hellopotext

Build tools:

    -   C/C++ compiler. On Linux etc., the GNU and Clang compilers are
        support. On Windows, currently tested only with the Mingw compiler.
    -   Python.
    -   Meson and Ninja. In Windows, they can be installed from
        the same Meson release '*.msi' file.
    -   C++17 and above is required to build Cfg66. The GNU and Clang
        compilers support it.
