This directory is where all build products will reside.  See the following

Note that we prefer to employ "3.1.2 Separate Header Placement".

Building the library:

    If this directory contains only this README file, then run one of the
    following command sets in the top-level project directory:

    A.  $ ./work
    B.  $ meson . build
        $ cd build
        $ ninja &> make.log

    If this directory is already populated, the following is an option:

    $ meson --reconfigure . build

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=sh
